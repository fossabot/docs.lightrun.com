title: Monitoring exceptions
---
Lightrun has the ability to monitor all the exceptions thrown in the
application and give insights about them.

**Note:** By default, every exception in the application will be
reported, even ones that get caught along the way.

Configuring the Agent {#_configuring_the_agent}
---------------------

In order to configure the agent to report the exceptions to the server
follow these steps:

1.  Go to the folder of the agent

2.  Open the `agent.config` file

3.  Find the property `exceptions_monitoring_enabled` and set it to `1`.
    It should look like this: `exceptions_monitoring_enabled=1`

4.  In case you want the agent to ignore exceptions that are caught
    along the way, find and set the `exceptions_should_report_caught`
    property to `0`.

5.  Restart your application with the agent

The Server {#_the_server}
----------

In the server you'll be able to see general statistics about the
exceptions and details of specific exceptions. To view the exceptions
table, click Exceptions â†’ Data

![Exceptions Menu](../../img/exceptions-menu.png)

In this page you'll be able to see a table with statistics on all the
exceptions thrown by all your applications.

![Exceptions Table](../../img/exceptions-table.png)

In the top right corner of the screen there are search options. You can
search with free text and by specific time frames or by custom range.

Clicking on a specific type of exception in the table will open a modal
with more details on the exception. Clicking on a specific exception in
the table (or navigating using the \"Previous/Next Exception\" buttons
above) you'll be able to see the stacktrace of each specific exception,
and for each frame in the stacktrace you can see the snapshot of the
frame.

The Plugin {#_the_plugin}
----------

In order to view the exceptions in the plugin click on the
\"Exceptions\" tab at the bottom of the Lightrun window

![Exceptions Tab in the Plugin](../../img/exceptions-plugin-tab.png)

In this view you can view exceptions from today and exceptions from the
last month.

Email Notifications {#_email_notifications}
-------------------

Lightrun can send you alerts to inform you on what is going on with the
exceptions in your applications. The alerts can be recurring
(weekly/daily) or they can be on various events that happened. To
configure these alerts go to \"Email Alerts\" at the menu bar.
