![Notification warning - \"Lightrun actions in this file were submitted
against a different
version...​\"](img/source-version-warning-notification.png)

This notification warning pops up when one or more actions in the open
file were set against different source code. This might happen if you
set an action after making edits to the file, or if an action was set to
the same file by another person whose source code differs from yours.

This warning can be ignored, as it doesn't block the activation of the
action. However, actions set on mismatching source code can cause
unexpected behavior, so it is recommended to solve the issue.

To solve the issue, make sure that the application you are debugging is
the same as the code in your editor (or the editor of whoever set the
action). If the problem persists, you can disable the warning by
clicking \"Don't Show this Again\" in the notification panel (Notice
that disabling this feature will also affect the actions the way other
people view the actions you set).
